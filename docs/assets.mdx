# JavaScript & Assets

import DocLink from "../src/components/DocLink.js"
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage'
import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl"

Assets require a <DocLink id="custom-domain" name="Custom Domain Name" /> to link properly when using API Gateway. For Function URLs, this works out of the box. Both API Gateway and Function URLs can benefit from a CloudFront CDN to cache `/assets` and avoid hitting your backend function on each request.

## Serving Static Assets

Our <DocLink id="quick-start" /> cookiecutter project leverages Rails' built in ability to serve static assets. We do this by setting this environment variable in your `Dockerfile`.

```docker title="Dockerfile"
ENV RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=1
```

We also add this configuration to your `config/environments/production.rb` file. In this case we are setting the cache control to 30 days, which you can change. The `X-Lamby-Base64` header signals to the Lamby rack adapter that the content requires base64 binary encoding.

```ruby title="config/environments/production.rb"
config.public_file_server.headers = {
  'Cache-Control' => "public, max-age=#{30.days.seconds.to_i}",
  'X-Lamby-Base64' => '1'
}
```

## Adding CloudFront

[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) is an amazing CDN and is pretty easy to setup with Rails. Simply point CloudFront to your Rails app and allow the origin to set the cache headers. Because we set the `public_file_server` headers above, everything should work out perfectly. Assuming you have setup a <DocLink id="custom-domain" name="Custom Domain Name" /> via CloudFront, here is how to setup an behavior for your `/assets` path. From your CloudFront distribution

- Click the "Behaviors" tab 
- Click "Create Behavior" button
- Path Pattern: `/assets/*`
- Select your API Gateway or Function URL origin.
- Compress objects automatically: Yes
- Viewer protocol policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD
- Restrict viewer access: No
- ðŸ”˜ Cache policy and origin request policy (recommended)
  - Cache policy: CachingOptimized
  - Origin request policy: None

## JavaScript Ready

Our <DocLink id="quick-start" /> cookiecutter project is ready to hit the ground running with all the latest Rails defaults for JavaScript & CSS development. We do this by adding Node.js to the development container which is also used to build your production image. See our <DocLink id="anatomy" /> guide for details.

For example, we can add the [TailwindCSS Rails](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails) gem, run the `./bin/rails tailwindcss:install` command, and edit the temporary starter index page like so. Once redeployed, we should see our Hello TailwindCSS page working correctly.

```ruby title="Gemfile"
gem 'tailwindcss-rails'
```

```html title="app/views/application/index.html.erb"
<h1 class="
    text-center
    text-9xl
    text-blue-400
    mt-5
    ">Hello TailwindCSS</h1>
```

<ThemedImage
  alt="TailwindCSS on Rails on Lambda"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/docs/tailwindcss-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/docs/tailwindcss-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
