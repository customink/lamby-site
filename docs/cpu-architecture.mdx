# CPU Architecture

Our [cookiecutter](https://github.com/customink/lamby-cookiecutter) project defaults to building a Linux container image targeting the `arm64` architecture vs the traditional `x86_64` cpu type. Applications that use arm64 (AWS Graviton2 processor) can achieve significantly better price and performance than the equivalent workloads running  an on x86_64 architecture.

Deploying arm64 applications is still a relatively new process and requires a few special considerations from local development to your CI/CD tooling. AWS Lambda makes this easy using the [Architectures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html#cfn-lambda-function-architectures) setting of the `AWS::Lambda::Function` CloudFormation resource. However, here are a few things you should know.

## Docker Images

Most base Docker images are now build for [multiple platforms](https://www.docker.com/blog/faster-multi-platform-builds-dockerfile-cross-compilation-guide/). Consider the following `Dockerfile`: 

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.2-bullseye
```

How does Docker know which platform to use? The anwser is to use the default platform of the host. If you are on a M1 or M2 Mac, arm64 would be the platform used. Which platforms are in a specific base image? We can find out using the `docker manifest` command. For example:

```shell
$ docker manifest inspect ruby:3.2 | grep arch
            "architecture": "amd64",
            "architecture": "arm64",
$ docker manifest inspect  | grep arch
            "architecture": "amd64",
            "architecture": "arm64",
```

All the images in our starter project are multi-platform. This means any host can be used for development. Your computer, Codespaces, etc will use the proper platform image variants.

## Deployment Gotchas

Though there are numerous ways to deploy containers using techniques such as emulation. However, we recommend you following one simple rule. Matching your “Development Host OS/Arch” to that of your target “Deployment Host OS/Arch” provides the least development friction. Use a CI/CD platform that matches your deployment target.

:::caution 
Currently GitHub Actions does not support native arm64 runners. They are [working to add](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/5631) this feature.
:::

Our <DocLink id="quickstart" /> guide has your first deploy happening from your local machine. Since we default to `arm64` this should work fine if you are on a Mac with Apple Silicon. But what if you are on a Windows or Linux system with an `x86_64` architecture? Your function will not work since your application's system dependences (like mysq2) will be compiled for the wrong architecture. Depending on your needs, you may have to switch back to `x86_64` as described below.

For more information on deployments, see our <DocLink id="anatomy" /> guide.

## Switching to x86_64

Based off the current state of our [cookiecutter](https://github.com/customink/lamby-cookiecutter) project, here are the changes required to switch to a `x86_64` deployment target. First, change your CircleCI workflows default machine from `arm.large`` to a standard large.

```diff title=".circleci/config.yml"
default-machine: &default-machine
   machine:
     image: ubuntu-2204:current
     docker_layer_caching: true
-  resource_class: arm.large
+  resource_class: large
```

Now open up your AWS SAM serverless `template.yaml` file, find the `RailsLambda` resource and change your Architecture property from `arm64` to `x86_64`.

```diff title="template.yaml"
 Properties:
   Architectures:
-    - arm64
+    - x86_64
```
